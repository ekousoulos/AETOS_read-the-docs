Overview
--------

This is the documentation for the **AETOS (Africa–Europe Energy Transition OSeMOSYS)** model, 
developed under the RE-INTEGRATE project (Horizon Europe, Grant No. 101118217).

The **Africa–Europe Energy Transition OSeMOSYS (AETOS)** model is a 
multi-country, open-source energy system model that explores 
long-term energy pathways and trade between Africa and Europe.  
It extends and integrates the **OSeMBE (Europe)** and **TEMBA (Africa)** 
frameworks, providing the most detailed representation to date of national power systems, intra-continental trade, and cross-continental grid interconnectors and gas pipelines.

AETOS is designed to analyze how Africa and Europe can transition toward 
net-zero energy systems while considering electricity and natural gas trade. The model enables researchers, policymakers, and 
analysts to explore scenarios that capture infrastructure investments, 
policy pathways, and sustainability targets across **78 countries**.


Key Features
------------


- **Geographic coverage**: 48 African countries and 30 European countries (incl. Finland, UK, Switzerland) each modeled individually.  
- **Time horizon**: 2021–2055 annual analysis.
- **Demand coverage**: National electricity generation and gas demand (other sectors such as transport, buildings, and services not explicitly modeled yet).  
- **Energy trade representation**: Grid interconnectors, Natural Gas pipelines, LNG infrastructure.  
- **Units & currency**: Capacities in GW, fuel flows in PJ, emissions in MtCO₂, and all costs in constant 2021 USD.

Finding the GitHub Repository
-----------------------------

All model code, data-processing scripts, and workflow tools are openly hosted in the
`AETOS GitHub repository <https://github.com/ekousoulos/AETOS_model>`_.
You can browse the source, submit issues, or contribute improvements.
